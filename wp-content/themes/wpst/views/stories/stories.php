                        age: 19
                        <br>occupation: First year student, unemployed

                    </h3>
                    <p class="u-zero-top epsilon">Moving out for the first time was scary, especially for Bethan who had never paid a bill bigger than a mobile contract. Being in her first year, she was worried about missing out on a fun opportunity of socialising, to be sure of affording food for the next week.</p>
                    <p class="u-zero-top u-zero-bottom epsilon">Having an overview of her account and monthly expenditure helped Bethan keep track of how much budget she had left for a given month. Sometimes, she even had a little bit to spare that she could add to her goal of a new laptop.</p>

                    <p class="u-zero-top epsilon">The pressures of additional deadlines and the prospect of job hunting meant Alex was inclined to put off any thought towards his finances. Knowing he had a student loan to start paying off as well as owing to the bank of mum and dad, Alex found it hard to even look at his account.</p>
                    <p class="u-zero-top u-zero-bottom epsilon">Constant encouragment through push notifications, a points based system and realistic rewards provided Alex with just the right incentive to change his ways. Within a few weeks, Alex had grasped a routine of working hard on his dissertation and having breaks with his mates, courtsey of the awards he had earnt by completing tasks.</p>

                    <p class="u-zero-top epsilon">Ciara quickly found herself in the wilderness of the job market, under constant pressure to get some money coming in. The stress of the unknown and having to keep on top of endless paperwork meant she often had to prioritise tasks - sometimes at the expense of her housemates.</p>
                    <p class="u-zero-top u-zero-bottom epsilon">Once a Lead Tennant was chosen, the group were able to put any differences aside. Keeping track of who had paid their share of the house bills became increasingly easier. The ability to send the occasional reminder to each other meant tempers were kept at bay and the group could enjoy each others company instead.</p>
